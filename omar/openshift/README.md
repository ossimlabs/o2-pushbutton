# Openshift Deployment Utilities

This directory contains various scripts and source files to aid in deploying individual services or the full omar stack to openshift.

The openshift templates are in the `templates` subdirectory. See the README file there.

Python scripts in the `python` sudirectory are used for parsing and writing JSON.

See the individual script files (or run them with -h option) for documentation and usage. Also see [OMAR Blue / Green Deployment document](https://radiantsolutions.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/OC2S/pages/28870059/OMAR+Blue+Green+Deployment) for full description and bigger picture.
